#Untitled 2D Platformer Game
##About
<p>This is a game idea I randomly had while taking a shower. My plan is to have the player alternate between RGB colors to solve puzzles and maneuver through the dangerous levels. Game is still in the prototype phase and I'm still trying out a lot of different things.</p>

##Game Instructions
<p>You can alternate the colors by using the R, G, and B hotkeys on your keyboard (in the future the player will be able to map out their own hotkeys through the menu settings). What the player color does in each level will be different so it'll be the player's job to figure out the game's mechanics.</p>
